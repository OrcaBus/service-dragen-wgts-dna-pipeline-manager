# Trouble Shooting

Most processes within the Dragen WGTS DNA Orchestration use AWS Step Functions to manage the workflow.
We post all Step Function errors to the #alerts-prod slack channel, a Center staff member can
then click on the offending Step Function link in the slack message to be taken to the AWS Step Functions console to investigate further.

## Analysis Stuck in DRAFT state.

If the analysis is stuck in DRAFT mode, there may be a couple of reasons for this.
To determine which issue is causing the problem we can head to the [AWS Step Functions Console][aws_step_functions_console_prod]
in the production account and look for any RUNNING executions in the 'dragen-wgts-dna--populate-draft-data' step function.

If there is a RUNNING execution for this library id, then the issue is likely due to the Step Functions hanging at the Fastq Sync step.
See the Fastq Sync stuck section below for more information for hanging processes.

If there is no RUNNING execution for this library id, then the issue is likely due to a payload being incomplete.
See the Payload Mismatch section below for more information on how to resolve this issue.

### Fastq Sync Stuck

The Fastq Sync step uses a heart-beat timeout so if the step function is genuinely stuck, it will eventually time out and fail the execution.
You may wish to then 'redrive' the execution from the console.
However, the Fastq Sync step will receive heartbeats if there are any active jobs running on that particular library id.
It may be the case that the step is waiting for either a fastq job to complete, such as qc stat calculation (usually taking around 20 minutes),
OR the fastq data is in archive and is in the process of being thawed (which may take several hours).

### Payload Mismatch

If you can find the most recent execution for this library id, then you may be able to look at the Log Group for the 'validate-draft-payload' lambda.

This lambda will let you know how the payload violates the expected schema.
You may wish to then manually update the payload and generate a new WorkflowRunUpdate draft event as discussed in [SOP 1][sop_1_rel_path]

## Analysis Stuck in READY state

If the analysis is stuck in READY state, then it is likely that the translation from the READY event to the ICAv2 WES event has failed.

## Analysis Fails to Start

The ICAv2 WES manager may fail to create an analysis for any of the following reasons:

### Project Not Set Up Correctly

This issue is mostly common with new projects often for research purposes that also use the OrcaBus system
to orchestrate the analyses.

Some common things to confirm can be:

* Ensure that the ICAv2 Production Service User has been added to the project with the correct permissions.
* Ensure that the Notifications Channels have been set up correctly for the project.

Please consult the [project setup SOP][icav2_wes_project_setup_sop] as part of the ICAv2 WES documentation

### Invalid Pipeline ID

> The pipeline id specified is not available in the project id

This can be mitigated with the following command from someone with ICAv2 access:

```
icav2 projects enter <project_id>
icav2 projectpipeline link <pipeline_id>
```

You will need to create a new workflow run after this change in order to reanalyse the library/libraries.

### Data Not Available

> Data .x. is not available in the project id <project_id>

If data is available via the S3 External Data Access Route from the ICAv2 WES manager, the WES manager will
use this route to access the data, which is the preferred method as it does not rely on data linking within ICAv2.

However, there may be times where this is not possible and the data needs to be linked within ICAv2.

The best possible solution would be to copy the data into the appropriate ICAv2 project and then
re-process the libraries to save the need of doing data linking within ICAv2.

If this is not possible, then you will need to link the data within ICAv2,
please consult the [ICAv2 Plugins Manual][icav2_wiki_page] for more information on how to do this.

## Common Dragen Failures

### Dragen Step Fails with a 137 Exit Code

This is likely due to insufficient memory. Structual Variant calling within Dragen is memory sensitive.
Unfortunately, there isn't much that can be done to mitigate this issue since we are restricted by the instance sizes.

It may be worth discussing with the project lead for this library to see if structural variant calling is required,
since we will also get the structural variants downstream through the ESVEE step of the oncoanalyser wgts dna pipeline.
